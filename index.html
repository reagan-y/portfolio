                        The goal for the new logo was first and foremost to simplify. The client was concerned about how the original logo wasn't condusive to one- or two-color printing, so the main concern was to create a logo that would function with many different colorways. Using the agreed upon logo redesign, the next step was to develope print media for Mighty Green. Taking two different creative directions, two versions of mailers, door hangers, and yard signs were presented.

They wanted their brand to feel natural and joyous but not too playful. The challenge of this brief was balancing something that felt gritty and natural, while also not making it too playful or child-like. After developing a primary and secondary logo inspired by the produce sold at the market, printed deliverables for the brand included paper bags, flyers, and thank you cards.
