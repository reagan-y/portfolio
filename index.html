Their mission is to provide a housekeeping service that not only gives their customers an excellent clean but also uses practices that are better for their clients and the planet. They wanted their branding to feel earthy and organic while also appealing to their younger client base, so we decided to go in a clean, minimalist direction while focusing on organic textures and colors.

                        Mighty Green is a local lawncare company in Alabama and is a part of the Turf Masters Brands Family. They were looking for a brand refresh that included an updated logo and some print media for Mighty Green. Their main concern about the original logo is that it wasn't condusive to one- or two-color printing, so the priority was to create a logo that would function with many different colorways. With the agreed upon logo redesign, two different creative directions were developed for print media including yard signs, mailers, and doorhangers.

                                The concept behind this Open House exhibition was centered around the transitional space of a home being moved out of. While spearheading the development of the logo, a cardboard box was chosen as a representation of both moving and of transitional space. As the box goes through a cycle of being broken down and built back up, the layers build up to create an abstracted and layered form of a house. Chaotic imagery and colors were also used to signify the varigated nature of the work being shown at the exhibition.

They wanted their brand to feel natural and joyous but not too playful. The challenge of this brief was balancing something that felt gritty and natural, while also not making it too playful or child-like. After developing a primary and secondary logo inspired by the produce sold at the market, printed deliverables for the brand included paper bags, flyers, and thank you cards.
